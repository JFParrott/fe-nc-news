# JP News

## About

This project was built using React and the styling was done with Styled Components.
A hosted version of the project can be found here:
https://nc-news-jp.netlify.app/

The application makes requests to an API which I built using Node.js and, in particular, Express.
For more information, the GitHub repository for that API can be found here:
https://github.com/JFParrott/nc-news

You can access the API directly by going to:
https://nc-news-jp.herokuapp.com/api/articles

The default user for this app is 'jessjelly'. This means that articles and comments created by this user may be deleted.
